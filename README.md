# Inspiration-by-Role-Models
Our experiences on social network sites (SNS) can often leave us envious of others, but othersâ€™ success can be inspirational as well. This study was an exploration of how source similarity, dispositional optimism, and goal attainability influence the outcomes of upward social comparisons with outstanding others. In an experiment in which participants were exposed to a success story on SNS (N = 200), source similarity was found to have a direct influence on inspiration, and dispositional optimism had an indirect influence on inspiration through perceived goal attainability. The findings provide both theoretical and practical implications regarding how best to utilize success stories on SNS to increase a sense of inspiration.
